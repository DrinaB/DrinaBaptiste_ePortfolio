            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my software development ePortfolio. I have been programming for about a year now using Javascript.  Here you will find enhancements that reflect my growth in areas such as software design, data structures, and database management using python. This is my Capstone Project for CS 499. This eportfolio reflects on my education at SNHU. </p>

            <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>When I started the computer science program at SNHU. I knew that it was going to be challenging even though i had a little bit of experience in Full Stack development. However, I was excited for this challenge because I knew that it would make me a better developer. I owe my progress to my professors for always providing great feedback. </p>
            <p> Completing the coursework throughout the program has helped me to amass great skills such as: OpenGL, MongoDB, Angular, Python, C++, Java, and much more. Learning these skills helped me to shape my goals by making me an all around developer. I am not just stuck to knowing one language. I have more skills to continue to advance in different areas. </p>
            <p> The most challenging class that I had was Comp Graphic and Visualization. This class focused on the use of OpenGl. Originally, I had no desire to learn this skill. However, it ended up being the most rewarding skill that I acquired. It forced me to think differently. It really helped that there was a supportive environment in this class. We had general discussion boards, and we all collaborated to help one another. Overall, all of my classes had a similar environment. This program has allowed me to gain skills that one would not see on paper. I am more well rounded and I have gained soft skills as well.</p>
            <p>The technical artifact that is presented in this portfolio demonstrate the depth and breadth of my computer science experience, focusing on key competencies in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design. The artifact stems from a foundational project—Grazioso Salvare—that I progressively enhanced to reflect industry best practices. The enhancements illustrate not only my ability to build functional and scalable applications, but also my growth in writing modular code, optimizing performance, and strengthening data reliability. Together, this artifact serves as a comprehensive representation of my technical abilities and my readiness to contribute to complex software development environments.</p>

            <h2>Artifact</h2>
            <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. I wanted to focus on this artifact specifically because of the technology used. Python, and MongoDB.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
            <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. I wanted to focus on this artifact specifically because of the technology used. Python, and MongoDB. As well as the algorithms used in this artifact. Python is a language that I am currently learning, as well as MongoDB. I wanted to improve my knowledge and skills for them. The specific components that I believed that I excelled on was data and the algorithms. I improved the artifact by removing repetition. I really wanted to clean my code and make it more modular and simpler to read. So removing all of the nearly identical if.. elif.. else statements and using filters reduce the chance of typos or bugs. Also, while cleaning the callback code.
            <p> I believe that with this enhancement I did achieve the following outcome: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution.-	Enhancing this artifact has been a great experience so far. I was able to revisit the project, and identify the core objective, and improve the user experience. Since, it was a simple update. I did not necessarily experience any challenges. The only hinderance was going over the codebase again, and making sure I know what each line is doing. Therefore, it was only time-consuming, not challenging.</p>   </p>

        <section id="enhancement2">
            <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>This enhancement focuses on the use of efficient data structures and algorithms to optimize application performance.</p>
            <p> The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago. -	I improved my project by optimizing the data structure through MongoDB indexing on frequently queried fields and enhancing the filtering algorithm by projecting only necessary fields. This reduces memory load, speeds up queries, and improves scalability, making the dashboard more efficient for large datasets. These show my skills to continue to scale an application overtime without making it full of bugs or being slow. I was able to improve my data structure to make my artifact faster.</p>
            <p>I did meet my course outcome that I had planned for this and this was course outcome: Improving the data structure and algorithm of my artifact.I learned that sometimes even the simplest changes will yield great results. For this enhancement improving the speed of the project is crucial in my opinion. You want to make sure that the app is running efficiently especially as I will be continuing to add to it. </p>

            <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
            <p>This enhancement focuses on improving database interactions and implementing best practices for data persistence and retrieval.</p>
            <p>The artifact that I will be using is the Grazioso Salvare application. This application serves to identify dogs for training. The software works with existing data from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. This was created about a month ago.</p>
            <p>This artifact is one that I wanted to include because I want to improve on Python, which is increasingly becoming more popular to use. Python will help me with being able to gain the skills that I need to do well with machine learning. Therefore, this artifact has allowed me to practice. My artifact was improved in the CRUD process. I wanted to include sorting and error handling.-	I learned the importance of error handling. Mainly because it will prevent your application from crashing. I ran into this problem in the class that the artifact was made. My app was crashing when it was running on dash. So now, including error handling has helped make the app run smoother.</p>
